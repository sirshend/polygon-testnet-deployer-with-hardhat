# Deploying multiple smart-contracts on Polygon testnet using Hardhat

Instead of just ```git clone```ing this repo, follow the steps listed below to build the deployer. 

## Sign-up for a free alchemy account 

If you follow the online tutorials, you will find several rpc endpoints for the polygin testnet(The polygon testnet is known as "mumbai"). Common ones include ```https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com``` , ```https://matic-mumbai.chainstacklabs.com``` etc. It isn't obvious which rpc endpoint is working right now, and at the time of writing, I couldn't make either of these 2 work. So it is better to get a free custom endpoint from Alchemy. 

This endpoint from Alchemy will connect to out Metamask wallet's account on the Mumbai testnet, and we will use the account & network details while deploying. Here is a link to Alchemy.[https://www.alchemy.com] [Click on signup on upper-right corner. It's free.]
